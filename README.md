# Reverse Geocode from CSV
## (Lat long to Address)

This project reads latitude and longitude coordinates from a CSV file and reverse geocodes them into an address.

### Steps to Run the project successfully
#### Step 1: Create a virtual environment (Just makes it easier to isolate your project environment)
If you're cool ðŸ˜Ž and use a Linux system, it is fairly simple.

Run the following commands:
```
$ python3 -m venv name-of-env
$ source name-of-env/bin/activate
```
Deactivate Virtual environment by running:
```
$ deactivate
```

#### Step 2: Install Packages
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Add your API key as an environment variable for SECURITY ðŸ”’ reasons
Run the following commands (Can only be run on UNIX systems) (Again for COOL people only ðŸ˜œ)

#### Step 4: Run main.py
```
python3 main.py
```

#### A test file exists in the same directory and can be used for testing ðŸ§ª
