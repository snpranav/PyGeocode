# PyGeocode
## Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding from CSV data

This project reads data from a CSV file. Then it geocodes or reverse geocodes data from csv based on user choice.

### Steps to Run the project successfully
#### Step 1: Create a virtual environment (Just makes it easier to isolate your project environment)
If you're cool ðŸ˜Ž and use a Linux system, it is fairly simple.

Run the following commands:
```
$ python3 -m venv name-of-env
$ source name-of-env/bin/activate
```
Deactivate Virtual environment by running:
```
$ deactivate
```

#### Step 2: Install Packages
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Add your API key as an environment variable for SECURITY ðŸ”’ reasons
Run the following commands (Can only be run on UNIX systems) (Again for COOL people only ðŸ˜œ)

#### Step 4: Run main.py
```
python3 main.py
```
The script is interactive from here onwards! ðŸ˜€

---
#### A test folder exists in the same directory that contains tests for geocoding and reverse geocoding respectively ðŸ§ª
